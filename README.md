# Matplotlib-Challenge
The efficiency of Pymaceuticals drug Capomulin on reducing the tumor volume of mice over a peried of treatment duration (upto 45 days) was evaluated in comparison to other treatment regimens included in the current study.

The datasets provided included - (a) Mouse metadata consisting of Mouse ID,	Drug Regimen,	Sex,	Age_months,	Weight (g) and (b) Study_data consisting of Mouse ID, Timepoint,	Tumor Volume (mm3) and	Metastatic Sites.

The datasets were merged together and duplicate data was removed before anlaysis was initiated. The analysis included determining the effiency of treatment with the experiemntal drug, Capomulin and compare it to the response of mice subjected to various other treatment regimen.   

Pandas dataframe, matplotlib, numpy, scipy.stats, linregress and jupyter notebook were employed to complete the necessary analysis. A short summary of the findings & inferences has been included at the beginning of the jupyter notebook file (Pymaceuticals-final.ipynb). The analysis included determining mean, median, var, std, sem, upper quartile, lower quartile, IQR, outliers, correlation cofficent, and r-squared value (linear regression).
